# hello-world
Personal repo for Rishi (public) 

I am a full stack software engineer and technical lead. Single-handedly built a custom PHP/PostgreSQL e-commerce site for a UK footwear retailer back in 2004, that grew to a multi-region / multilingual ‘high medium’ business, which paved the way to hiring, training & managing a 10-person engineering team, working as  small project-centric teams.

My experience can be classified as 'wearing multiple hats' in engineering, project management, problem analysis and product management, with my ultimate passion lying in delivering high quality, simple solutions to complex problems, and effective communication to bridge our clients' businesses with technology.
